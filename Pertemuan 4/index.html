        BTS was originally supposed to be a hip hop group similar to YG Entertainment's 1TYM,
        but between their initial formation and their debut, Bang Si-hyuk decided that the contemporary

     The lineup was then finalized with Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook in 2012 when Jin, 
        the oldest member of the group, was twenty-years-old.

        as well as song covers on YouTube and SoundCloud.
